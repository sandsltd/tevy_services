Subject: SEO Update - July Analysis

Hi Ellie,

Just wanted to keep you in the loop on what I've been working on for Tevy Services' SEO.

I've analyzed the last 3 months of Google Search Console data, specifically focusing on keywords that are almost on page 1 but not quite performing. Found some really interesting insights:

We have 123 keywords ranking at the bottom of page 1 (positions 7-10) that are getting good impressions but very few clicks - only a 1.05% click-through rate. This is way below what we should be seeing for page 1 rankings.

Some standout examples:
- "alloy wheel repair devon" is getting 107 impressions at position 7.6 but zero clicks
- "alloy wheels exeter" has 206 impressions but only 1 click despite ranking 8.3
- We have 60 "near me" searches in this range with 470 total impressions

The good news is these represent quick wins - moving from position 8 to position 5 is much easier than getting new keywords to rank, and the traffic difference is huge (typically 5x more clicks).

I've identified which pages need attention and I'll be working on optimizing these over the next few weeks. Based on the data, focusing on these keywords should bring in an extra 100+ visitors per month.

Just thought you'd like to know what I'm focusing on and why. Will keep you posted on progress!

Cheers,
Nick
