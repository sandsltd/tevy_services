Subject: SEO Update - Targeting Page 1 Keywords for Quick Wins

Hi Ellie,

I've completed an analysis of our Google Search Console data from the last 3 months and put together a comprehensive SEO report focusing on a specific opportunity I've identified.

**What I've Done:**

I analyzed all 1,000 keywords we're tracking and specifically focused on the 123 keywords that are ranking at the bottom of page 1 (positions 7-10). These represent our biggest opportunity for quick improvements.

**Why This Approach:**

Moving keywords from position 8 to position 5 is much easier than getting new keywords to page 1. These keywords are already deemed relevant by Google - they just need optimization to climb those final few spots. The difference in click-through rate between position 8 (1.05%) and position 5 (5-7%) means we could 5x our traffic from these terms.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Zero-Click Gold Mines**: Found 9 keywords getting decent impressions but zero clicks, including:
   - "alloy wheel repair devon" (107 impressions, position 7.6)
   - "south west alloys" (68 impressions, position 9.9)

2. **Poor CTR on High-Volume Terms**: "alloy wheels exeter" gets 206 impressions but only 0.49% CTR despite ranking 8.3

3. **Near Me Searches**: 60 keywords containing "near me" with 470 total impressions - perfect for local optimization

**The Action Plan:**

I've created a prioritized 3-month roadmap focusing on:
- Week 1-2: Meta tag optimization (quick wins)
- Week 3-4: Creating 4 new landing pages for high-opportunity keywords
- Ongoing: Local SEO improvements and review generation

**Expected Impact:**

Based on typical results, we should see:
- Month 1: 20-30% CTR increase
- Month 2: 50% traffic increase from these keywords
- Month 3: 100% increase in conversions

The full report is attached with detailed recommendations, templates, and timelines. 

The beauty of this approach is that we're not trying to rank for new competitive terms - we're maximizing keywords where we already have Google's trust. It's like being 7th in a race and having a clear path to 4th place.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss the recommendations or need any clarification on the findings.

Best,
Nick
