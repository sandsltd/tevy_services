                Your vehicle's tyres are the only point of contact between your car and the road, making them one of the most critical safety components. At TEVY Services in Exeter, we provide comprehensive tyre services to ensure your vehicle remains safe, efficient, and performing at its best.
              </p>

              <h2>Why Proper Tyre Maintenance Matters</h2>
              <p>
                Proper tyre maintenance isn't just about avoiding flat tyres â€“ it's about ensuring optimal vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, and most importantly, safety. Worn or improperly inflated tyres can:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Increase stopping distances, especially in wet conditions</li>
                <li>Reduce fuel efficiency, costing you more at the pump</li>
                <li>Compromise handling and stability</li>
                <li>Increase the risk of dangerous blowouts</li>
                <li>Lead to MOT failures</li>
              </ul>

                Not all tyre damage requires a complete replacement. For minor punctures and damage within the repairable area, our skilled technicians can perform professional repairs that restore your tyre's integrity and extend its lifespan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our repair process involves:

                Unbalanced wheels can cause vibration, uneven tyre wear, and stress on your vehicle's suspension components. Our precision wheel balancing service ensures your wheels rotate smoothly, providing a comfortable ride and extending the life of your tyres.
              </p>

              </p>

              <h2>Tyre Services FAQs</h2>
              
              <h3>How often should I replace my tyres?</h3>
              <p>
                Tyres should typically be replaced every 6 years regardless of tread depth due to rubber degradation. However, depending on your driving habits and conditions, you may need to replace them sooner if the tread depth falls below 1.6mm (the legal minimum in the UK). For optimal performance and safety, we recommend considering replacement when tread depth reaches 3mm.
              </p>

              <h3>Can you match a single tyre to my existing ones?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, we can source individual tyres to match your existing set. However, we recommend replacing tyres in pairs (on the same axle) for optimal handling and safety, especially if your current tyres have significant wear.
              </p>

              <h3>How long does a tyre fitting service take?</h3>
              <p>
                For a standard set of four tyres, our service typically takes 45-60 minutes. This includes removal of old tyres, fitting new ones, balancing, and safety checks. Single tyre replacements or repairs can often be completed in 20-30 minutes.
              </p>
