Searching for **"alloy wheel refurbishment near me"** usually means one thing: your wheels need attention and you want someone local who can do a proper job. If you're in Exeter or anywhere across Devon, TEVY Services is exactly what you're looking for.

## What Is Alloy Wheel Refurbishment?

Refurbishment goes beyond a simple repair. It's a complete restoration of your alloy wheels — stripping them back, repairing any damage, and refinishing them to a factory-fresh standard. The result is wheels that look brand new.

### Painted Finish

Classic solid colour refinish — silver, gunmetal, gloss black, or any custom shade to match your style.

### Diamond Cut

Precision-machined on a CNC lathe for that distinctive bright, reflective finish found on modern vehicles.

### Custom Finish

Two-tone, satin, matte, or bespoke colours to give your vehicle a unique look.

## Why Choose a Local Refurbishment Service?

There are plenty of alloy wheel refurbishment companies around, but going local has real advantages. With TEVY Services based in Exeter, you get:

- **Easy drop-off and collection:** No need to post your wheels across the country or wait days for shipping. Drop them off and pick them up locally.
- **See the workshop:** You can visit our premises, see the equipment we use, and speak to the people doing the work. That transparency matters.
- **Local reputation:** We rely on word of mouth in the Exeter area. Our reputation depends on doing quality work for our neighbours.
- **Mobile option available:** For cosmetic repairs and minor refurbishment, we can come to you — at home or at work across Devon.
