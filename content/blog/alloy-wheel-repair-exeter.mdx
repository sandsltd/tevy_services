Your alloy wheels take a beating. Between Exeter's narrow streets, tight car parks, and the occasional pothole on the A30, it's only a matter of time before they pick up some damage. The good news is that most **alloy wheel damage can be repaired** to a standard that looks as good as new — and it costs a fraction of replacing them.

## Common Types of Alloy Wheel Damage We Repair

### Kerb Damage

- Scuffs from parking too close to the kerb
- Gouges from catching a raised edge
- Rim scrapes from tight manoeuvres
- Chipped edges and paint loss

### Surface Damage

- Scratches from road debris
- Brake dust corrosion
- Clear coat peeling or flaking
- Oxidation and discolouration

## Why Repair Rather Than Replace?

A single new alloy wheel from a main dealer can easily cost £300 to £800 depending on the make and model. A set of four? You're looking at well over £1,000. Professional alloy wheel repair in Exeter typically costs a fraction of that, and the results are virtually indistinguishable from a brand new wheel.

Beyond the cost savings, repairing your existing wheels is also the more environmentally responsible choice. Manufacturing new alloy wheels requires significant energy and raw materials. Repairing extends the life of what you've already got.

## Our Repair Process

At TEVY Services, we use professional-grade equipment and techniques to restore alloy wheels across Exeter. Here's what happens when you bring your wheels to us:

### 1. Assessment

We inspect the damage and advise on the best repair approach. Not all damage is the same — a kerb scuff needs different treatment to corrosion or a crack.

### 2. Stripping & Preparation

The damaged area is carefully stripped back, sanded smooth, and prepared for filling. For diamond cut wheels, this involves lathe preparation.

### 3. Repair & Reshape

We fill, build up, and reshape the damaged area to match the original profile of the wheel. This step is critical for a seamless finish.

### 4. Colour Match & Paint

Using our colour matching system, we match the exact shade of your wheels. Whether it's silver, gunmetal, gloss black, or a custom colour — we get it right.

### 5. Clear Coat & Cure

A protective clear lacquer is applied and properly cured to ensure durability and a factory-quality finish that lasts.

## Diamond Cut Alloy Wheel Repair

Diamond cut alloy wheels have become increasingly popular on modern vehicles. They have a distinctive bright, machined finish that looks stunning but is also more susceptible to damage. Repairing diamond cut wheels requires specialist CNC lathe equipment — not something every repair shop has.

At TEVY Services, we offer full [diamond cut alloy wheel repair](/blog/diamond-cut-vs-painted-alloys) in Exeter. The wheel is mounted on our precision lathe where a fine layer of alloy is machined away to reveal a fresh, gleaming surface. It's then sealed with a clear lacquer to protect the finish.

## When Should You Get Your Wheels Repaired?

The short answer: sooner rather than later. Damaged alloy wheels aren't just a cosmetic issue. Left untreated, [kerb damage exposes bare alloy](/blog/signs-of-alloy-wheel-damage-exeter) to the elements, which leads to corrosion. What starts as a small scuff can turn into flaking paint, pitting, and eventually structural weakening of the wheel.

### Before an MOT

Damaged wheels can affect tyre seal and cause slow punctures — an MOT failure point. If you're experiencing air loss, our [puncture repair services](/puncture-repairs) can help diagnose whether the issue is with the tyre or the wheel seal.

### Before Selling

Clean wheels significantly increase perceived vehicle value and help achieve a better price.

### Seasonal Check

After winter is a great time to assess and repair damage from cold weather and poor road surfaces.
