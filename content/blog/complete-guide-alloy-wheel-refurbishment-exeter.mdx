Noticed kerb damage on your alloy wheels? You're not alone. Over 70% of drivers in Exeter will experience some form of alloy wheel damage during their vehicle ownership, whether from tight multi-storey car parks in Sidwell Street, the notorious kerbs around Princesshay, or Devon's persistent pothole problem.

The good news? Professional alloy wheel refurbishment in Exeter can restore your wheels to showroom condition for a fraction of the cost of replacement. With prices starting from £60 per wheel and same-day services available, there's never been a better time to address that cosmetic damage that's been bothering you.

This comprehensive guide covers everything Exeter drivers need to know about alloy wheel refurbishment, from understanding the different processes to choosing the right finish for your vehicle.

## What Is Alloy Wheel Refurbishment?

Alloy wheel refurbishment is the professional process of restoring damaged or deteriorated wheels back to their original—or even better—condition. Unlike simple touch-ups or DIY repair kits, proper refurbishment involves completely stripping the wheel back to bare metal, repairing any structural damage, and applying a factory-quality finish.

The process addresses common issues including:

- **Kerb damage and scuffs** – scratches from parking mishaps
- **Corrosion and oxidation** – particularly common on diamond cut wheels
- **Paint peeling or bubbling** – caused by road salt and moisture
- **Minor dents and deformations** – from pothole impacts
- **General wear and discolouration** – accumulated road grime and brake dust

Professional refurbishment not only improves your vehicle's appearance but can also increase its resale value by hundreds of pounds—especially important for lease vehicles where end-of-contract charges for wheel damage can be substantial.

## Alloy Wheel Refurbishment Costs in Exeter

Understanding pricing helps you budget appropriately and avoid unpleasant surprises. Here's what you can expect to pay for alloy wheel refurbishment in Exeter in 2026:

### Standard Painted Finish
- **Minor scuffs and scratches:** £60-£75 per wheel
- **Moderate damage:** £75-£90 per wheel
- **Severe damage requiring welding:** £95-£120 per wheel

### Diamond Cut Finish
- **Standard refurbishment:** £85-£100 per wheel
- **With significant repairs:** £100-£130 per wheel
- **Complex multi-spoke designs:** £110-£140 per wheel

### Powder Coating
- **Single colour powder coat:** £70-£95 per wheel
- **Custom colours:** £85-£110 per wheel
- **Special finishes (satin, gloss, metallic):** £95-£130 per wheel

Most Exeter specialists, including [TEVY Services' mobile wheel repair service](https://www.tevyservices.co.uk/mobile-alloy-wheel-refurbishment), offer discounts when refurbishing a full set of four wheels. You'll typically save 10-15% compared to individual wheel pricing.

### What Affects the Final Price?

Several factors influence the cost of alloy wheel refurbishment:

- **Wheel diameter:** Larger wheels (19-inch and above) cost more due to material and labour requirements
- **Design complexity:** Multi-spoke designs take longer to mask and finish properly
- **Damage severity:** Deep gouges requiring welding or filler add to labour time
- **Finish type:** Diamond cutting requires specialised CNC equipment, increasing costs
- **Mobile vs workshop:** Mobile services may carry a premium for convenience, though competition in Exeter keeps prices competitive

## The Professional Refurbishment Process Explained

Understanding what goes into proper alloy wheel refurbishment helps you appreciate why it costs more than a quick spray job—and why the results last years rather than months.

### 1. Initial Assessment and Quote

A reputable Exeter wheel specialist will thoroughly inspect each wheel to identify:
- Visible damage (scuffs, scratches, dents)
- Hidden issues (cracks, buckles, internal corrosion)
- Original finish type (painted, diamond cut, powder coated)
- Repairability and recommended approach

This assessment determines whether refurbishment is viable or if replacement is the safer option—particularly important for wheels with structural damage.

### 2. Wheel Removal and Tyre Deflation

Wheels are removed from your vehicle (or you can bring wheels only if you have winter wheels stored). Tyres are deflated and, if necessary, removed from the rim to allow complete access to the wheel surface and inner barrel.

### 3. Chemical Stripping

The existing finish is chemically stripped or media-blasted away to reveal bare aluminium alloy. This step removes all paint, lacquer, corrosion, and contamination—essential for a lasting finish. Shortcuts here result in premature failure.

### 4. Structural Repairs

Any damage beyond cosmetic is addressed at this stage:
- **Welding:** For cracks and significant gouges
- **Straightening:** Using specialist hydraulic presses to correct buckles
- **Filling:** High-quality filler for minor imperfections

This is where experienced technicians distinguish themselves—poor repairs can affect wheel balance and safety.

### 5. Surface Preparation

The wheel is shot-blasted or sanded to create the perfect surface profile for primer adhesion. This step is crucial for preventing future peeling or corrosion. A powder coat primer or acid etch primer is then applied.

### 6. Applying the Finish

The final finish depends on your chosen option:

**For Painted Wheels:**
Multiple coats of colour-matched paint followed by high-gloss lacquer create a durable, uniform finish. Modern 2K lacquers offer excellent UV and chemical resistance.

**For Diamond Cut Wheels:**
The wheel face is precision-machined on a CNC lathe to create the distinctive metallic finish, then sealed with specialist diamond cut lacquer. Learn more about this premium option at [TEVY's diamond cut service page](https://www.tevyservices.co.uk/services/diamond-cut).

**For Powder Coated Wheels:**
Electrostatically applied powder is oven-cured at high temperature, creating an extremely durable finish that's more resistant to chips and corrosion than liquid paint.

### 7. Quality Control and Reassembly

Final inspection ensures perfect finish quality before tyres are refitted, wheels balanced, and reinstalled on your vehicle. Reputable specialists will also check tyre pressures and condition.

## Choosing Your Refurbishment Finish

The finish you select impacts both appearance and long-term durability. Here's how to choose:

### Standard Painted Finish

**Best for:** Most OEM painted wheels, budget-conscious refurbishment, custom colour changes

**Advantages:**
- Most affordable option
- Fastest turnaround time
- Excellent colour-matching capability
- Good durability with proper preparation

**Considerations:**
- Not suitable for wheels originally diamond cut
- Slightly less impact-resistant than powder coating
- May show brake dust more than diamond cut finishes

### Diamond Cut Finish

**Best for:** Wheels originally manufactured with diamond cut faces, premium and prestige vehicles

**Advantages:**
- Stunning metallic appearance
- Authentic OEM look
- Excellent brake dust resistance
- Premium feel that enhances vehicle value

**Considerations:**
- Higher initial cost (typically £20-30 more per wheel)
- More susceptible to corrosion if lacquer is compromised
- Cannot be easily touched up—requires complete re-cutting
- Not all designs can be diamond cut if not originally manufactured that way

Diamond cut wheels are particularly popular on Audi, BMW, Mercedes, and VW models. If your wheels originally had this finish, maintaining it preserves your vehicle's aesthetic integrity. For a detailed comparison, check out our guide on [diamond cut vs painted alloys](/blog/diamond-cut-vs-painted-alloys) to understand which finish best suits your needs.

### Powder Coating

**Best for:** Maximum durability, custom colours, track or performance vehicles

**Advantages:**
- Extremely durable and chip-resistant
- Superior corrosion protection
- Wide range of colours and finishes available
- Excellent for harsh conditions (winter use, track days)
- Can be applied to inner barrel for complete protection

**Considerations:**
- Slightly higher cost than standard painting
- Colour matching OEM finishes can be more challenging
- Requires specialised oven equipment
- Longer curing process

Powder coating is an excellent choice if you're changing wheel colour entirely or want maximum protection for wheels that see hard use.

## How Long Does Refurbishment Take?

Timing varies based on the service type and damage extent:

- **Standard refurbishment:** 2-5 days for most Exeter workshops
- **Same-day service:** Available from specialist mobile services like TEVY for minor repairs
- **Diamond cut refurbishment:** 3-7 days due to CNC machining requirements
- **Complex repairs:** Up to 10 days if welding and structural work is needed

Mobile alloy wheel repair services in Exeter can often provide faster turnaround by coming to your home or workplace, eliminating the need to drop off and collect your vehicle multiple times.

## Mobile vs Workshop Refurbishment in Exeter

Exeter drivers have two main options for alloy wheel refurbishment: traditional workshop services or mobile specialists who come to you.

### Workshop-Based Refurbishment

**Advantages:**
- Full access to all equipment (CNC lathes, powder coating ovens)
- Ability to handle all repair types
- Often slightly lower pricing

**Considerations:**
- Requires dropping off your vehicle or wheels
- May be without your car for several days
- Need to arrange alternative transport

### Mobile Alloy Wheel Refurbishment

**Advantages:**
- Completed at your home, workplace, or chosen location
- No vehicle downtime
- Often same-day service for minor to moderate damage
- Convenient scheduling around your routine

**Considerations:**
- May have limitations on severe structural repairs
- Diamond cutting typically requires workshop equipment
- Slight premium for convenience (though competitive in Exeter)

For many busy Exeter residents, particularly those in Newton Abbot, Torquay, or across wider Devon, [mobile wheel refurbishment](https://www.tevyservices.co.uk/mobile-alloy-wheel-refurbishment) offers the perfect balance of quality and convenience. If you're weighing up the pros and cons of each approach, our article on [mobile vs workshop alloy wheel refurbishment](/blog/mobile-vs-workshop-alloy-wheel-refurbishment-exeter) provides a detailed comparison to help you decide.

## Maintaining Your Refurbished Wheels

Proper maintenance extends the life of your refurbishment significantly:

### Cleaning Best Practices

- Use pH-neutral wheel cleaners—avoid acidic or alkaline products that damage lacquer
- Clean wheels when cool, never in direct sunlight
- Use soft brushes or microfibre cloths, never abrasive pads
- Rinse thoroughly to remove all cleaning product residue
- Dry with a clean microfibre towel to prevent water spots

### Protection Tips

- Apply wheel sealant or wax every 3-4 months for additional protection
- Address any chips or scratches promptly before corrosion develops
- Avoid automatic car washes with harsh chemicals
- Check tyre pressures regularly—under-inflation causes excessive flex and potential wheel damage

### Seasonal Considerations

Devon's winter weather is particularly harsh on alloy wheels:

- Road salt accelerates corrosion—rinse wheels weekly during winter
- Inspect for damage after pothole strikes (increasingly common on Devon roads)
- Consider switching to winter wheels if you have them
- Apply additional protective coating before winter months

With proper care, quality alloy wheel refurbishment should last 3-5 years or more—diamond cut wheels may need refinishing sooner (typically 2-4 years) due to lacquer degradation.

## Warning Signs You Need Refurbishment

Don't wait until damage becomes severe. Watch for these indicators:

- **Visible kerb damage or scuffs** – even minor damage allows moisture ingress
- **Corrosion or pitting** – particularly on diamond cut wheel faces
- **Paint peeling or bubbling** – indicates primer failure
- **Discolouration or staining** – often impossible to clean away
- **Rough or flaky texture** – lacquer breakdown
- **Brake dust that won't clean off** – indicates surface degradation

Addressing these issues promptly prevents more extensive (and expensive) repairs later. Learn how to [spot alloy wheel damage before it gets worse](/blog/signs-of-alloy-wheel-damage-exeter) with our detailed guide to early warning signs.

## Choosing a Refurbishment Specialist in Exeter

With several alloy wheel refurbishment services operating in Exeter, particularly around the Marsh Barton industrial estate, how do you choose the right one?

### Key Selection Criteria

**Experience and Reputation:**
Check Google reviews, Facebook testimonials, and before-and-after photos. Established specialists with consistent five-star ratings indicate reliable quality.

**Guarantees:**
Reputable services offer warranties on their work—typically 12 months minimum. This protects you against premature finish failure.

**Process Transparency:**
Quality specialists will explain their process, show you the damage, and discuss repair options honestly. Be wary of vague descriptions or pressure to proceed immediately.

**Insurance and Credentials:**
Ensure the business has proper liability insurance and uses approved materials and processes.

**Realistic Pricing:**
If a quote seems too good to be true, it probably is. Proper refurbishment requires time, skill, and quality materials—these have a cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can all alloy wheels be refurbished?**

Most can, but wheels with severe structural damage (major cracks, significant bends) may need replacement for safety reasons. A thorough inspection determines repairability.

**Will refurbishment affect my wheel balance?**

Professional refurbishment shouldn't affect balance when done correctly. Quality specialists will rebalance wheels as part of the service.

**How many times can diamond cut wheels be refurbished?**

Typically 2-3 times before insufficient material remains. Each diamond cut process removes a thin layer of aluminium.

**Is refurbishment worth it compared to replacement?**

Almost always—replacement wheels often cost £200-£500 each, whereas refurbishment costs £60-£130 per wheel. You save hundreds while maintaining OEM quality.

**Can I change my wheel colour during refurbishment?**

Absolutely. Refurbishment is the perfect opportunity for custom colour changes, whether subtle shade variations or complete transformations.
