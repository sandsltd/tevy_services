## Diamond Cut Finish

Diamond cutting is a precision process that involves using a specialized lathe to remove a thin layer of metal from the wheel's face, creating a pristine, mirror-like finish. This process reveals the raw aluminum beneath, resulting in a distinctive two-tone appearance when combined with painted inner sections.

### Advantages:

- Premium, factory-quality finish
- Unique metallic shine that painted finishes can't replicate
- Excellent for modern, premium vehicles
- Can increase vehicle value

## Painted Finish

A painted finish involves thoroughly preparing the wheel surface, applying primer, and then finishing with high-quality paint and clear coat layers. This versatile option allows for various color choices and finishes.

### Advantages:

- More durable in harsh conditions
- Easier to maintain
- Wide range of color options
- Generally more cost-effective
- Suitable for all wheel types

## Making Your Decision

Consider these factors when choosing between diamond cut and painted finishes:

1. Original wheel finish
2. Vehicle type and value
3. Local climate and driving conditions
4. Maintenance preferences
5. Budget considerations
