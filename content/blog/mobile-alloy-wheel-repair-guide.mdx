## Understanding Mobile Wheel Repair

Mobile alloy wheel repair has revolutionised the way vehicle owners in Exeter maintain their wheels. Rather than spending hours at a workshop, you can have professional repairs carried out whilst you continue with your day — whether that's working from home, at the office, or even whilst doing the weekly shop.

Our mobile technicians arrive fully equipped with all the tools, paints, and materials needed to restore your alloy wheels to their former glory. We use the same high-quality products and techniques as traditional workshops, ensuring your wheels receive the professional treatment they deserve.

## What Can Be Repaired?

### Kerb Damage

- Light to moderate scuffs
- Scratches and scrapes
- Minor rim damage
- Paint chips and marks

### Cosmetic Issues

- Faded or discoloured finish
- Surface corrosion spots
- Clear coat peeling
- Brake dust staining

### Touch-Up Work

- Colour matching repairs
- Small area refinishing
- Lacquer restoration
- Edge protection

## The Mobile Repair Process

### 1. Initial Assessment

We examine your wheels and provide an accurate quote.

### 2. Preparation

Thorough cleaning and sanding of the damaged area.

### 3. Repair Work

Filling, shaping, and smoothing any damage.

### 4. Colour Matching

Precise paint matching to your wheel's original finish.

### 5. Finishing

Application of protective clear coat and final polish.

## Mobile vs Workshop Repairs

Whilst mobile repair offers tremendous convenience, it's important to understand when each option is most appropriate. Mobile services excel for cosmetic repairs, minor damage, and touch-up work. However, for more extensive damage, structural issues, or diamond cut wheel refurbishment, our workshop facilities provide the controlled environment and specialist equipment needed for the best results.

### Choose Mobile For

- Convenience and time-saving
- Minor cosmetic repairs
- Touch-ups and refreshes
- Busy schedules

### Choose Workshop For
