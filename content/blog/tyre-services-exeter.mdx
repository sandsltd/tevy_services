## Maxxis Tyres Lifetime Guarantee

### Peace of Mind at No Extra Cost

We are so confident in the quality, reliability and durability of Maxxis products that we have no hesitation in offering a lifetime guarantee if our road tyres are found wanting in terms of manufacture or materials. This confidence is based on the knowledge that Maxxis tyres undergo such a rigorous development process before being brought to market. This cornerstone of Maxxis corporate strategy has been pivotal in its success and continues to raise the bar for standards in the whole industry.

### The Maxxis Lifetime Guarantee

- Maxxis will replace a road tyre which demonstrates a defect due to the manufacturing process or materials used.
- Maxxis will replace a road tyre which shows irreparable damage resulting from normal road use.
- This lifetime guarantee operates independently of the purchase date and is non-transferable from the party named on the guarantee certificate.

This lifetime guarantee does not affect your statutory rights. Replacement is based on dealer assessment where a replacement value is calculated based on the amount of tread used.

### How to Claim

To make a claim under the terms of your Maxxis Lifetime Guarantee, please take your tyre/s to your local Maxxis dealer. (The use of the Guarantee in respect of tyre/s invalidates any further claims).

The Maxxis Lifetime Guarantee is offered by our UK Distributors, Stapleton's Tyre Services on car, van, 4x4 and van tyres. The Maxxis Lifetime Guarantee is offered by Maxxis International UK plc for road motorcycle tyres listed on this web site.

### The Guarantee Coverage

1. A tyre with 8mm or more tread remaining will be replaced with a new Maxxis tyre of the same size and type (or corresponding type if range has changed).
2. Tyres with less than 8mm of the tread remaining will be replaced subject to assessment by the dealer.

Note: Please consult your Maxxis dealer for details.
